This is a project for interior designers to experience the rooms they design as someone in a wheelchair. This allows the designer to get insights on how to make the room more accessible to handicapped people.

This project was created for the Oculus Rift. The Oculus touch controllers are used to move and interact with things. Moving the wheelchair requires grabbing the wheels and making a pushing motion with the controllers. Some objects can be picked up using the controllers. There is a scene for demontration.
